# UDICTI START-UP ACADEMY (USA) IN COLLABORATION WITH STARTHUB AFRICA

# COACHING PLAN FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 2022/23

## Explanation of the overall concept:

-   The first semester focuses on establishing an entrepreneurial mindset, the second semester focus on finding an idea and a team,the practical training will focus on practically implementing an idea.

-   We suggest taking in 50 students for the 1^st^ and 2^nd^ semester

-   We suggest taking in 10 teams for the practical training whereby teams shall have 2 -- 3 members and need to qualify to be selected

-   We suggest not to force students to find members within the group, but they can find a co-founder outside the group as long as the team leader him/herself participated in semester 1 and 2.

We see three potential options.

1.  The university pays for a 6 -- 12 months accelerator program similar like the StartHub Catalyer which come with weekly individual mentorship and coaching.

2.  The university connects students to other accelerator programs / Hubs in TZ.

3.  Students apply to the StartHub Catalyzer program and startups which fit StartHub's criteria and agree to the terms and conditions can be taken on.
